## Why CleanAPI?
If you are building for the web, mobile, or IoT you will likely end up needing API services. CleanAPI can help by allows you to access hundreds of API services from one place. CleanAPI has a single basic language that allows you to access and control most used API services. CleanAPI's unique features contribute to your project.
